#Installing Node and Express#

1- Open the terminal and check you have node installed by typing 'node -v'
You should have something similar to 'v.20.15.1'

2- Next you need to initialise your project using 'npm init'
You can choose the values for the properties of the package you are creating or you can select default values by using 'npm init -y'

3- In your package.json file, add a '"type" : "module"' property:value to make this an ES module

4- Go to http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html and follow the instructions to install Express on your project

5- Create a JavaScript file called 'index.js' in your project directory. You can run this file by typing 'node index.js' in your terminal
